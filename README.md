Welcome! This Github repository is used to store and update all of the data science projects done by students at Poggio Civitate. If you want to look through code, please read through the **Navigating** section first. If you are trying to add your own code, please read the **Editing** section before getting started.

### Navigating
The organization of this repository is simple to navigate through. The **projectslandingpage** is where the **index** file is for this project, as well as the HTML and CSS for the **projects** page.

The other folders each hold the code for one of the data science projects.

### Editing -- Data Science Students ONLY
Before adding your own projects to this repository, it is important to understand the conventions of the repository so that it remains organized and easy to navigate. Find the conventions of this repository listed below:

**Adding Your Project to the Repository**
To add a project to this Github repository, please upload all of the files (including images, etc.) into a new folder that is named after your project or describes it in some way. Please ensure that all external media is properly cited somewhere in your project.

**Adding Your Project to the Website**
To add a project to the website itself, please follow the formatting used for the other projects, and place your code below the last numbered project, but before the project called "last project". Follow the conventions used in the CSS file to add a background image to your file as well. Make sure to add your code both to the index.html code as well as the projects-page.html code.
